Functions

Proc.h
	In struct thread, we added 2 variables. uint32_t tickets, and
	char ticketed. Tickets is the number of tickets the thread has
	ticketed is wether or not the thread has gotten it's initial 500
	tickets

Runq.h
	Added the following headers:
		struct  thread *runq_lottery_choose(struct runq *rq);
		struct	thread *runq_choose(struct runq *);

sched_ule.c
	- added 3 new rtq(runtime queues) in tdq(thread queues) struct one for interactive, one for 
		  timeshare and one for idle (251-253)
	- Add the 3 new tdqs in tdq_setup(tdq) (1394-1396, which initialize the 3 rtq)
	tdq_runq_add (only modified): (460)
		- set the default number of tickets to 500, and set ticketed
		  to true (520)
		- Check to see if the process being looked at adding is a root
		  process with sys_getuid(td, 0) (477), then we used the information
		  in td->retval[0] to determine if it was root
		- All system processes are still handled the same way they 
		  would be in freeBSD as instructed
		- All user processes would then go into lottery_add(runq, td)

	tdq_choose (only modified)
		- all the user realtime and system processes are given priority
		- Then we pick from the pool of user timeshare and idle
		  processes via the runq_lottery_choose function
		- If all fail return null.

	sched_nice (only modified)
		- Call sched_takeaway_tickets or sched_give_tickets depending
		  on whether the nice value is positive or negative. 

	sched_give_tickets(td, score) 
		- Give tickets to the process depending on its score, which is
		  determined in sched_priority (which is also the function that
		  calls this function).

	sched_takeaway_tickets(td, score)
		- Take away tickets from the process depending on its score, 
		  which is determined in sched_priority (which is also the 
		  function that calls this function)

	sched_priority (only modified) 
		- Call sched_takeaway_tickets or sched_give_tickets depending
		  on the priority score.

kern_switch.c
	runq_lottery_add(runq, td):
		- runq = the runq selected, td = the thread being added
		- We set priority to 1 and stack all of the threads on just 
		  pri 1.
		- Then we just TAILQ_INSERT_BACK(rqh, rd, td_runq)
	runq_lottery_choose(runq)
		- runq = the runq selected
		- Just like runq_add, but:
		- we set the priority to 1
		- we count the total number of tickets in the queue
		- Determine a winner via random() % (total tix + 1)
		- We itterate the whole queue again and find the winner via a
		  counter that gets compared to the winner, and return the 
		  thread.
		  if (current_tickets >= winner) return (td);
		- Otherwise return NULL

Testing
***********************************************************************

$ Read dumpfiles
	via kgdb to read vmcore.0 for when we initially were getting
	page faults.

	This was helpful to show us that we had clearly messed something
	up besides the scheduler and thus we started over from scratch

$ Print Statements
	By putting in print statements at certain points in the code we
	were able to narrow down where our issues were.

	This is how we knew that lottery scheduling was actually being
	used correctly and thus we had completed the assignment.
